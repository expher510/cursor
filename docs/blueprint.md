## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 75%, 50%) which converts to a vibrant blue (#3391FF) to create a sense of trust, intelligence, and focus, fitting for language learning.
- Background color: Desaturated blue at HSL(210, 20%, 98%), which converts to (#F9FBFF). It provides a light, non-distracting backdrop to maintain focus on the content.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-green at HSL(180, 60%, 45%), which converts to (#40BFB0), highlights interactive elements and CTAs without overpowering the primary color.
- Body text: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that is clean, modern, and highly readable, making it ideal for the app's transcript and other textual content.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font that is more unique and can be used in short snippets to set things off from body text.
- Sidebar-based layout with a clean, modern design for intuitive navigation.
- Use a set of minimalist icons. Ensure icons are consistent in style.
